# 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

Your DreamSpace application is now configured for native GitHub Pages deployment!

## ✅ What's Been Set Up

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Automatically builds and deploys on push to main
2. **Vite Configuration**: Updated for GitHub Pages with proper base path
3. **Package Scripts**: Added `predeploy` and `deploy` scripts
4. **Build Configuration**: Optimized for modern browsers
5. **Custom Domain**: Configured for `dreamspace.tylerstewart.co.za`

## 🎯 How to Deploy

### Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
Simply push your changes to the main branch:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main
```

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
- Build your application
- Deploy to GitHub Pages
- Make it available at your custom domain

### Manual Deployment (Alternative)
If you prefer manual deployment:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

## 🔧 GitHub Repository Settings

To enable GitHub Pages:

1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/Baby-Ty/Dreamspace
2. Click **Settings** → **Pages**
3. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
4. Your site will be available at: https://dreamspace.tylerstewart.co.za

## 📁 Files Structure

```
.github/
└── workflows/
    └── deploy.yml          # GitHub Actions workflow
public/
└── .nojekyll              # Prevents Jekyll processing
└── logo.png               # App logo
└── CNAME                  # Custom domain configuration
vite.config.js             # Updated for GitHub Pages
package.json               # Added deployment scripts
```

## 🌐 Custom Domain

Your custom domain `dreamspace.tylerstewart.co.za` is configured via:
- `CNAME` file in the repository root
- Vite config set to serve from root path (`/`)

## 🔄 Deployment Process

1. **Trigger**: Push to main branch
2. **Build**: GitHub Actions runs `npm ci` and `npm run build`
3. **Deploy**: Built files from `dist/` folder are deployed to GitHub Pages
4. **Live**: Site updates at your custom domain

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check GitHub Actions logs in the **Actions** tab
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Verify there are no syntax errors

### Site Not Updating
- Check if GitHub Actions workflow completed successfully
- Verify GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
- Clear browser cache

### Custom Domain Issues
- Ensure DNS is pointing to GitHub Pages servers
- Verify CNAME file contains correct domain
- Check domain configuration in repository settings

## 📊 Performance Notes

- Build size: ~813 KB (gzipped: ~188 KB)
- Consider code splitting for better performance
- Static assets are cached for optimal loading

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Your DreamSpace application will now automatically deploy to GitHub Pages whenever you push changes to the main branch. No more manual deployment steps needed!
