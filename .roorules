- Avoid adding to much code to a single page, instead try breaking the functionality of what you are adding into components or multiple files 

- I prefer functional programming over oop 

- Code should be terse but use human friendly variable names.
- Avoid right lean
- Use short circuits instead of nested conditionals 
- Avoid nested exceptions
- Avoid one line conditional returns or continues.
- new Files should be no longer than 150 lines of code. Break large functionality into several files.
