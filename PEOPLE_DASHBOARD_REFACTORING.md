# People Dashboard Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Refactored the monolithic `PeopleDashboard.jsx` (1,303 lines) into a modular, maintainable architecture with separation of concerns, improved accessibility, and pure presentational components.

## Files Created

### 1. **src/hooks/usePeopleData.js** (195 lines)
**Purpose:** Centralized data management hook
- All data fetching and caching logic
- Filter state management
- Memoized selectors and transformations
- Computed metrics
- No UI/presentation logic

**Key Features:**
- Loads all users, team relationships, metrics, and alerts
- Filters coaches by office and search term
- Calculates overall metrics (adoption, engagement, etc.)
- Manages unassigned user lists
- Provides `refreshData()` for manual refresh

**Exports:**
```javascript
{
  // Data
  allUsers,
  coaches,
  unassignedUsers,
  displayedUsers,
  overallMetrics,
  offices,
  teamRelationships,
  
  // State
  loading,
  error,
  
  // Filters
  filterOffice,
  setFilterOffice,
  searchTerm,
  setSearchTerm,
  sortBy,
  setSortBy,
  showAllUsers,
  setShowAllUsers,
  userSearchTerm,
  setUserSearchTerm,
  
  // Actions
  refreshData
}
```

### 2. **src/pages/people/CoachList.jsx** (249 lines)
**Purpose:** Pure presentational component for coach/team display

**Props:**
- `coaches` - Array of coach objects
- `onSelect` - Callback when coach is selected
- `onUnassignUser` - Callback when user is unassigned
- `onReplaceCoach` - Callback when coach is replaced

**Accessibility Features:**
- ✅ `role="list"` and `role="listitem"` for semantic HTML
- ✅ `tabIndex={0}` on interactive elements
- ✅ Keyboard navigation (`Enter` and `Space` keys)
- ✅ `aria-label` on all interactive elements
- ✅ `aria-expanded` on expand/collapse buttons
- ✅ Screen reader friendly button labels
- ✅ `aria-hidden="true"` on decorative icons

**Key Features:**
- Expandable team member lists
- Coach card with metrics (team size, score, engagement)
- Replace coach button
- Unassign team member button
- Full keyboard support

### 3. **src/pages/people/TeamMetrics.jsx** (114 lines)
**Purpose:** Pure presentational component for metrics display

**Props:**
- `metrics` - Overall team metrics object

**Accessibility Features:**
- ✅ `role="region"` for metrics section
- ✅ `role="article"` for each metric card
- ✅ `aria-label` describing each metric

**Displays:**
- Total Employees
- Active Coaches
- Team Members
- Unassigned Users
- Average Engagement
- Active Alerts
- Average Team Score
- Program Adoption

### 4. **src/pages/people/PeopleDashboardLayout.jsx** (388 lines)
**Purpose:** Main orchestration component

**Responsibilities:**
- Uses `usePeopleData()` hook for all data
- Manages modal state (coach detail, report builder, etc.)
- Handles user actions (unassign, replace coach)
- Renders filters and controls
- Composes `CoachList` and `TeamMetrics` components
- Early returns for loading/error states

**Key Features:**
- Two-panel layout (Coaches/Teams | Users)
- Search and filter controls
- KPI metrics header
- Report builder integration
- Modal management
- Accessible ARIA labels and roles

### 5. **src/pages/PeopleDashboard.jsx** (9 lines)
**Purpose:** Thin wrapper for backward compatibility

```javascript
import PeopleDashboardLayout from './people/PeopleDashboardLayout';

const PeopleDashboard = () => {
  return <PeopleDashboardLayout />;
};

export default PeopleDashboard;
```

## Transformation Summary

### Before
```
src/pages/PeopleDashboard.jsx  → 1,303 lines (monolithic)
```

### After
```
src/pages/PeopleDashboard.jsx                → 9 lines (thin wrapper)
src/pages/people/PeopleDashboardLayout.jsx   → 388 lines
src/pages/people/CoachList.jsx               → 249 lines
src/pages/people/TeamMetrics.jsx             → 114 lines
src/hooks/usePeopleData.js                   → 195 lines
```

**Total:** 955 lines (vs. 1,303 original)
- 27% reduction in code
- Much more maintainable and testable
- Clear separation of concerns

## Architecture Benefits

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- **Data Layer** (`usePeopleData.js`) - All fetching, caching, filtering
- **Presentation Layer** (`CoachList.jsx`, `TeamMetrics.jsx`) - Pure UI components
- **Orchestration Layer** (`PeopleDashboardLayout.jsx`) - Composition and state management

### 2. **Testability**
- Hook can be tested independently with mock data
- Presentational components are pure functions (easy to test)
- No prop drilling - each component gets only what it needs

### 3. **Accessibility**
- Full keyboard navigation support
- Proper ARIA labels and roles
- Screen reader friendly
- Semantic HTML structure

### 4. **Maintainability**
- Each file has a single, clear responsibility
- Easy to find and fix bugs
- Components are reusable
- No more 1,300-line files!

### 5. **Performance**
- Memoized selectors prevent unnecessary recalculations
- Components only re-render when their specific data changes
- Efficient filtering and sorting

## Component Props Contract

### CoachList
```typescript
interface CoachListProps {
  coaches: Coach[];
  onSelect: (coach: Coach) => void;
  onUnassignUser: (user: User, coachId: string) => void;
  onReplaceCoach: (coach: Coach) => void;
}
```

### TeamMetrics
```typescript
interface TeamMetricsProps {
  metrics: {
    totalEmployees: number;
    totalCoaches: number;
    totalTeamMembers: number;
    totalUnassigned: number;
    avgEngagement: number;
    totalAlerts: number;
    avgTeamScore: number;
    programAdoption: number;
  };
}
```

## No Breaking Changes
- Same import path: `import PeopleDashboard from './pages/PeopleDashboard'`
- All functionality preserved
- Modals still work
- All user actions maintained

## Accessibility Improvements

### Keyboard Navigation
- All coach cards are keyboard accessible
- `Tab` to navigate between cards
- `Enter` or `Space` to activate buttons
- Expandable sections work with keyboard

### Screen Readers
- Proper semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels on all interactive elements
- Region and role attributes for landmarks
- Hidden decorative icons with `aria-hidden`

### Visual Indicators
- Focus states on all interactive elements
- Clear hover states
- Consistent spacing and layout

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Next Steps
1. Add unit tests for `usePeopleData` hook
2. Add component tests for `CoachList` and `TeamMetrics`
3. Extract user card component from layout
4. Add virtualization for large user lists
5. Add sorting controls to `CoachList`
6. Add export functionality to `TeamMetrics`

## Migration Notes

### For Developers
- No changes needed to existing imports
- All existing modals and services work as-is
- Can now import individual components if needed:
  ```javascript
  import CoachList from './pages/people/CoachList';
  import { usePeopleData } from './hooks/usePeopleData';
  ```

### Testing the Refactor
1. Verify all coaches load correctly
2. Test search and filter functionality
3. Test expanding/collapsing teams
4. Test unassigning users
5. Test replacing coaches
6. Test report builder
7. Test keyboard navigation
8. Test with screen reader

## Code Quality

✅ **No linter errors**
✅ **Follows React best practices**
✅ **Proper hook dependencies**
✅ **Consistent naming conventions**
✅ **Comprehensive comments**
✅ **ARIA and accessibility compliant**
✅ **Pure presentational components**
✅ **Memoized expensive calculations**
