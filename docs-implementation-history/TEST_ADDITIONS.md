# Test Additions Summary

Created minimal test files for hooks and components following the project's testing standards.

## Added Test Files

### 1. `src/hooks/usePeopleData.test.js`
**Purpose:** Test the people data hook that manages coach/team data

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Returns shaped data with coaches array
- ✅ Calculates overall metrics (totalEmployees, totalCoaches)
- ✅ Provides filter functions (setFilterOffice, setSearchTerm)

**Approach:** Mocks peopleService to return shaped `{ success, data }` responses

---

### 2. `src/hooks/useDreamConnections.test.js`
**Purpose:** Test the dream connections hook with pagination and debouncing

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Loads connections and provides pagination data
- ✅ Provides pagination controls (goToNextPage, goToPrevPage, goToPage)
- ✅ Provides filter setters (setCategoryFilter, setLocationFilter, setSearchTerm)
- ✅ Handles search term updates (debounced behavior)
- ✅ Handles errors gracefully

**Approach:** Mocks peopleService, verifies pagination state, tests debounced search

---

### 3. `src/components/coach/CoachDetailModal.test.jsx`
**Purpose:** Test the coach detail modal component for accessibility and interactions

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Renders modal with role="dialog" and aria-modal
- ✅ Displays coach name and email
- ✅ Closes modal when close button is clicked
- ✅ Closes modal when Escape key is pressed (focus trap)
- ✅ Does not render when coach is null
- ✅ Prevents body scroll when modal is open
- ✅ Snapshot test

**Approach:** Mocks child components and useCoachDetail hook, uses role-based queries

---

## Testing Strategy

### Minimal & Focused
- Tests verify basic shape and behavior only
- No over-testing of implementation details
- Role-based queries for accessibility
- Snapshot tests for visual regression

### Mocking
- Service layers fully mocked to return `{ success, data }` format
- Child components mocked to isolate unit under test
- Context providers mocked with minimal data

### Dependencies Added
```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^14.x",
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^6.x"
  }
}
```
