## Purpose & Design Philosophy

### Core Concept
- **Card-first interaction**: Tap to select, type only when optional details are needed
- **Progressive reveal**: One step at a time with smooth transitions
- **Aligned with existing design system**: Uses Netsurit colors, Tailwind patterns, Lucide icons
- **Coach-like tone**: Warm, encouraging, playful-professional balance

### User Journey Flow
1. **Welcome** ‚Üí Sparkles intro with single CTA
2. **Vibe** ‚Üí Pick the year's energy (Reset, Grow, Launch, Explore, Level Up)
3. **Themes** ‚Üí Multi-select key focus areas (Health, Learning, Career, etc.)
4. **Avoid Options** ‚Üí Optional constraint filters (no mornings, no gym, low budget, etc.)
5. **Dream Templates** ‚Üí Tap pre-built suggestions matched to themes
6. **Focus Dreams** ‚Üí Star top 3 "big rocks" for the year
7. **Milestones** ‚Üí Choose pattern per dream (Consistency/Deadline/General)
8. **Weekly Rituals** ‚Üí Pick tiny checkboxable actions with frequency
9. **Review** ‚Üí Vision Bio + summary with "Start My Year" CTA

## Design System Integration

### Visual Elements
- **Colors**: Netsurit red/coral/orange gradients, professional gray scale
- **Typography**: Inter font, responsive text hierarchy
- **Cards**: `rounded-xl` with `border-2`, hover states with shadow lifts
- **Buttons**: Gradient CTAs (red ‚Üí coral), white secondary buttons
- **Icons**: Lucide React (Sparkles, CheckCircle2, Target, Calendar, Repeat, etc.)
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions (200-300ms), scale on selection, pulse on active

### Layout Patterns
- **Full-screen modal**: Fixed overlay with centered content, max-w-6xl
- **Progress dots**: Horizontal indicator in header
- **Sticky bottom nav**: Back/Continue buttons with step counter
- **Grid layouts**: 2-3 columns for cards, responsive breakpoints
- **Card selection states**:
  - Default: `border-professional-gray-200`
  - Hover: `border-netsurit-coral hover:shadow-lg`
  - Selected: `border-netsurit-red bg-gradient-to-br from-netsurit-light-coral/10 shadow-lg`

### Component Patterns Used
- **Vibe cards**: Large icon cards (5 options)
- **Theme chips**: Inline flex-wrap with emoji + label
- **Dream templates**: Grid cards with title, why, category, checkmark overlay
- **Focus list**: Ranked list with numbered badges (1-3)

## Features Demonstrated

### 1. No-Go Filter (Step 4)
- **Purpose**: Teach AI what to avoid before showing suggestions
- **Options**: Time constraints, modality preferences, resource limits, social preferences
- **Effect**: Filters dream templates and cadence suggestions downstream

### 2. Quick Sheets (Optional Micro-Typing)
- **Concept**: Tap card ‚Üí optional detail panel slides up
- **Inputs**: Count steppers, period chips, duration, location, intensity, free note
- **Examples**:
  - Gym: 3x/week, 45min, "no Mondays"
  - Hiking: 2x/month, local trails
  - Learning: 4x/week, 25min, evenings only

### 3. Auto-Advance Logic
- **Vibe selection**: Auto-advances after 0.5s delay
- **Milestone/ritual selection**: Advances to next dream automatically
- **Continue button**: Enables only when step requirements met

### 4. Vision Bio Generation
- **Inputs**: Vibe + themes + focus dreams
- **Output**: 1-2 paragraph narrative + one-line "North Star" tagline
- **Editable**: Edit icon in review step

## Data Model (Conceptual)

### Selections State
```javascript
{
  vibe: 'grow',
  themes: ['health', 'learning', 'career'],
  avoids: ['no-mornings', 'low-budget'],
  dreams: [
    { id: 'h1', title: 'Run a 10K', why: 'Build endurance', category: 'Health' },
    { id: 'l1', title: 'Master React', why: 'Level up skills', category: 'Learning' }
  ],
  focusDreams: ['h1', 'l1', 'c1'], // 3 dream IDs
  milestones: {
    'h1': { type: 'consistency', targetWeeks: 12 },
    'l1': { type: 'consistency', targetWeeks: 12 }
  },
  weeklyRituals: {
    'h1': { id: 'r1', title: 'Run 3x/week, 30 min', count: 3, period: 'week' },
    'l1': { id: 'r5', title: 'Code practice 4x/week, 25 min', count: 4, period: 'week' }
  },
  cadence: {
    'h1': { days: ['tue', 'thu', 'sat'], time: 'morning' }
  }
}
```

### Output Objects (Align to Existing Schema)
```javascript
// Dreams
{
  id: generated,
  title: 'Run a 10K',
  category: 'Health',
  why: 'Build endurance and energy',
  priority: 1, // 1-3 for focus dreams
  milestones: [...]
}

// Milestones
{
  id: generated,
  text: '12-week consistency track',
  type: 'consistency',
  targetWeeks: 12,
  startDate: '2025-10-11',
  coachManaged: false, // user-created via builder
  streakWeeks: 0
}

// Weekly Goals
{
  id: generated,
  title: 'Run 3x/week, 30 min',
  dreamId: dreamId,
  milestoneId: milestoneId,
  recurrence: 'weekly',
  weekLog: {},
  active: true,
  // Optional metadata
  frequency: { count: 3, period: 'week' },
  duration: 30,
  cadence: { days: ['tue', 'thu', 'sat'] }
}
```

## Integration Points (Future Implementation)

### Entry Points
1. **Dashboard CTA**: "Build Your Year" card with gradient background
2. **DreamsWeekAhead**: "Build my plan" button if no weekly goals exist
3. **DreamTrackerModal**: "Add Milestone/Ritual with AI" for single dream

### Post-Chat Handoff
- **Navigation**: Route to `/dreams-week-ahead` with current week selected
- **Data Creation**: Call AppContext actions (`ADD_DREAM`, `ADD_WEEKLY_GOAL`)
- **Toast Notification**: "Your year is ready! Check off your first win this week. üéØ"
- **Milestone Expansion**: Auto-expand milestones in DreamTrackerModal to show linked goals

### Coach Continuity
- **Coaching Notes**: Store motivators, constraints, "watch-outs" for Dream Coach
- **Avoid Tags**: Prevent coach from suggesting conflicts (e.g., "no mornings")
- **Preferences**: Tone (gentle/cheer), celebration style, nudge cadence

### Dream Connect
- **Match Data**: Use themes/categories for better connection suggestions
- **Avoid Tags**: Filter out mismatched connects (e.g., travel-heavy if "local only")

## Design Decisions

### Why Card-First?
- **Lower barrier**: Tapping is easier than typing, especially on mobile
- **Guided exploration**: Users see options they wouldn't think of
- **Faster completion**: Reduces decision fatigue and blank-page paralysis
- **Better mobile UX**: Large touch targets, minimal keyboard usage

### Why Progressive Reveal?
- **Focused attention**: One question at a time prevents overwhelm
- **Context building**: Each step informs the next
- **Momentum**: Small wins (step complete) keep users engaged
- **Mobile-friendly**: Scrolling is minimal, no need to jump around

### Why No-Go Filter First?
- **Personalization signal**: Shows AI "understands" constraints early
- **Smarter suggestions**: Filters out mismatches before user sees them
- **Interactive engagement**: Tapping "avoids" is low-stakes, builds trust
- **Prevents frustration**: User doesn't see suggestions they can't do

### Why 3 Focus Dreams?
- **Research-backed**: 3 is the magic number for prioritization (not too few, not too many)
- **Achievable**: Users can realistically maintain 3 weekly rituals
- **Forces tradeoffs**: Prevents overcommitment, encourages intentionality

### Why 12-Week Consistency Default?
- **Quarter-aligned**: Matches business planning cycles
- **Long enough**: Builds real habits (research: 66 days avg)
- **Short enough**: Feels achievable, prevents long-term dread
- **Streak-friendly**: Weekly checkboxes for 12 weeks = clear progress visualization

## Microcopy Examples

### Warm & Encouraging
- "Nice! 3 Dreams starred ‚≠ê"
- "Your year is ready! üéâ"
- "Start My Year üöÄ"
- "Keep it simple ‚Äì what's one tiny action you'd actually do?"

### Coach-Like Questions
- "What's the vibe for your best year?"
- "Which themes matter most right now?"
- "What should we avoid this year?"
- "Tap a few Dreams that excite you"
- "Star your top 3 big rocks"
- "How do you want to make progress?"
- "Choose a tiny weekly action"

### Helpful Nudges
- "Pick 2-5 areas to focus on"
- "Optional ‚Äì helps us tailor suggestions"
- "Pick at least 3 ‚Äì you'll narrow down next"
- "Make it smaller" (button)
- "Add custom Dream" (dashed card)
