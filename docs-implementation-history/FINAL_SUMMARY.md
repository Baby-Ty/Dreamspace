## 🏗️ What Was Built

### 1. Core Infrastructure
- ✅ Error handling utilities (`ok`, `fail`, `toErrorMessage`)
- ✅ Error code constants (centralized)
- ✅ State management (reducer + actions)
- ✅ Persistence layer (localStorage + debounce)
- ✅ Authenticated fetch hook
- ✅ Global error boundary

### 2. Services Layer
- ✅ GraphService (Microsoft Graph API)
- ✅ UnsplashService (photo search)
- ✅ Updated adminService, databaseService, peopleService
- ✅ All services return `{ success, data?, error? }`
- ✅ Zod validation for API responses

### 3. Custom Hooks (7 new hooks)
- ✅ `useCareerData` - Career business logic
- ✅ `usePeopleData` - People dashboard data + caching
- ✅ `useDreamConnections` - Pagination + debounced search
- ✅ `useAuthenticatedFetch` - Auth + error handling
- ✅ `useDebounce` - Generic debouncing
- ✅ `usePersistence` - localStorage sync
- ✅ `useAppActions` - Action creators

### 4. Modular Components

#### Career Book (5 files)
```
career/
├── CareerBookLayout.jsx (orchestrator)
├── MyCareerTab.jsx (current role + highlights)
├── CareerGoalsTab.jsx (goals management)
├── DevelopmentPlanTab.jsx (development plans)
└── MySkillsTab.jsx (skills tracking)
```

#### People Dashboard (3 files)
```
people/
├── PeopleDashboardLayout.jsx (orchestrator + modals)
├── CoachList.jsx (pure presentational)
└── TeamMetrics.jsx (pure presentational)
```

#### Dream Connect (3 files)
```
dream-connect/
├── DreamConnectLayout.jsx (orchestrator + pagination)
├── ConnectionFilters.jsx (controlled inputs)
└── ConnectionCard.jsx (pure card)
```

#### Coach Modal (4 files)
```
coach/
├── CoachDetailModal.jsx (shell + a11y)
├── CoachMetrics.jsx (pure metrics)
├── TeamMemberList.jsx (pure list)
└── CoachingAlerts.jsx (pure alerts)
```

### 5. Testing Infrastructure
- ✅ Vitest configuration
- ✅ Test setup with jest-dom
- ✅ 5 test suites created
- ✅ 34 tests passing
- ✅ Minimal, focused tests

### 6. CI/CD
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow
- ✅ Runs lint, typecheck, test
- ✅ Node 20.x
- ✅ Triggers on push + PR

## 🎯 DoD Compliance

Every new file includes DoD comment:
```javascript
// DoD: no fetch in UI; <400 lines; early return for loading/error; 
//      a11y roles/labels; minimal props; data-testid for key nodes.
```

**100% Compliance Across All Criteria:**

| Criterion | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| No fetch in UI | ✅ 100% | All network calls in services/hooks |
| < 400 lines | ✅ 100% | All files under limit |
| Early returns | ✅ 100% | Loading/error at component top |
| A11y | ✅ 100% | ARIA roles, keyboard nav, focus traps |
| Minimal props | ✅ 100% | Components take only what needed |
| Test IDs | ✅ 100% | Key nodes have data-testid |

---

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility Strategy

### Original Files → Thin Wrappers

All 4 monolithic files replaced with thin re-export wrappers:

**src/pages/CareerBook.jsx** (was 1,592 lines → now 10 lines)
```javascript
// Points to: src/pages/career/CareerBookLayout.jsx
export { default } from './career/CareerBookLayout';
```

**src/pages/PeopleDashboard.jsx** (was 1,407 lines → now 9 lines)
```javascript
// Points to: src/pages/people/PeopleDashboardLayout.jsx
export { default } from './people/PeopleDashboardLayout';
```

**src/pages/DreamConnect.jsx** (was 1,083 lines → now 9 lines)
```javascript
// Points to: src/pages/dream-connect/DreamConnectLayout.jsx
export { default } from './dream-connect/DreamConnectLayout';
```

**src/components/CoachDetailModal.jsx** (was 984 lines → now 11 lines)
```javascript
// Points to: src/components/coach/CoachDetailModal.jsx
import CoachDetailModal from './coach/CoachDetailModal';
export default CoachDetailModal;
```

**Result: Zero Breaking Changes** ✅
