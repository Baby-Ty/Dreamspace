# Template On-Demand Goal Instance Fix

**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Issue**: Too many documents in Cosmos DB `items` container

## Problem

The previous implementation created **12 week instances upfront** for each recurring goal, resulting in:
- **Excessive Cosmos DB documents**: 1 recurring goal = 12 documents
- **High RU consumption**: Writing 12 documents at once
- **Database clutter**: Hundreds of unnecessary documents
- **Poor scalability**: 100 recurring goals = 1,200 documents

Example from user's Cosmos DB:
```
goal_1761145924682_2025-W43
goal_1761145924682_2025-W44
goal_1761145924682_2025-W45
... (12 instances total)
```

## Root Cause

In the week-entity fix, we created week-specific goal instances to solve the "all weeks update" problem. However, we over-engineered by **pre-creating instances** for future weeks that users might never view.

## Solution: Template + On-Demand Instance Creation

### New Architecture

1. **For One-Time Goals**:
   - Create 1 document with `weekId` for that specific week
   - No change from previous implementation ✅

2. **For Recurring Goals**:
   - Create 1 **template document** (`type: 'weekly_goal_template'`)
   - Store goal pattern, dream linkage, recurrence rules
   - **NO week instances created upfront**

3. **On-Demand Instance Generation**:
   - When user views a week (e.g., navigates to "Week Ahead")
   - Check if week instance exists for each active template
   - If not, create instance **just for that week**
   - Save to Cosmos DB

### Document Reduction

**Before**: 1 recurring goal → 12 documents  
**After**: 1 recurring goal → 1 template + instances as needed (1-3 typically)

**Savings**: ~90% reduction in documents for recurring goals

## Implementation Details

### 1. Schema Changes (Already Existed)

```javascript
// Template document
{
  id: "goal_template_1234567890",
  type: "weekly_goal_template",
  title: "Exercise 3x per week",
  description: "...",
  dreamId: "dream_123",
  milestoneId: "milestone_456",
  recurrence: "weekly",
  active: true,
  durationType: "unlimited", // or "weeks", "milestone"
  durationWeeks: 12, // if durationType === "weeks"
  startDate: "2025-10-22T00:00:00.000Z",
  createdAt: "2025-10-22T00:00:00.000Z"
}

// Week instance (created on-demand)
{
  id: "goal_template_1234567890_2025-W43",
  type: "weekly_goal",
  weekId: "2025-W43",
  title: "Exercise 3x per week",
  templateId: "goal_template_1234567890",
  completed: false,
  // ... other fields
}
```

### 2. Goal Creation Changes

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/DreamsWeekAhead.jsx` - Manual goal creation
- `src/components/DreamTrackerModal.jsx` - Milestone-based goal creation
- `src/context/AppContext.jsx` - Dream creation with consistency milestones
- `src/pages/VisionBuilderDemo.jsx` - Guided setup
- `api/getUserData/index.js` - Load templates into state

**Before**:
```javascript
// Create 12 instances upfront
const weeksToCreate = getNextNWeeks(currentWeek, 12);
weeksToCreate.forEach(weekId => {
  addWeeklyGoal({ id: `${baseId}_${weekId}`, weekId, ... });
});
```

**After**:
```javascript
// Create ONLY template
const template = {
  id: `goal_template_${Date.now()}`,
  type: 'weekly_goal_template',
  title: '...',
  recurrence: 'weekly',
  active: true,
  durationType: 'unlimited'
};
addWeeklyGoal(template);
```

### 3. On-Demand Instance Creation

**Location**: `src/pages/DreamsWeekAhead.jsx`

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Get active templates
  const activeTemplates = weeklyGoals.filter(goal => 
    goal.type === 'weekly_goal_template' && goal.active
  );
  
  // For each template, create instance if needed for this week
  activeTemplates.forEach(template => {
    const instanceExists = weeklyGoals.some(g => 
      g.templateId === template.id && g.weekId === activeIsoWeek
    );
    
    if (!instanceExists) {
      const weekInstance = {
        id: `${template.id}_${activeIsoWeek}`,
        weekId: activeIsoWeek,
        templateId: template.id,
        // ... copy template fields
      };
      addWeeklyGoal(weekInstance); // Saves to Cosmos DB
    }
  });
}, [activeIsoWeek, activeTemplates, weeklyGoals]);
```

### 4. Template Management

- **Templates in State**: Loaded along with week instances in `weeklyGoals` array
- **Template Filtering**: UI filters out templates when displaying goals
- **Template Lifecycle**: 
  - Set `active: false` to stop generating new instances
  - Keep existing week instances (historical data)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create recurring goal from "Week Ahead"
- [ ] Verify only 1 template document created in Cosmos DB
- [ ] Navigate to current week → instance created
- [ ] Navigate to future week → new instance created
- [ ] Navigate to past week (no template at that time) → no instance
- [ ] Create dream with consistency milestone
- [ ] Verify template created, no upfront instances
- [ ] View weeks → instances appear correctly
- [ ] Complete a week instance → only that week marked complete
- [ ] Use "Find Inspiration" → templates created correctly
- [ ] Guided setup → templates work

## Migration Strategy

**Existing Data**:
- Old `weekLog` goals: Migrated automatically in `api/getUserData/index.js`
- Old 12-instance goals: Will remain but be phased out as users create new goals
- No breaking changes for existing users

**Cleanup** (Optional):
- Could add script to consolidate old 12-instance goals into templates
- Not urgent - they will naturally phase out

## Benefits

1. **Cost Reduction**: ~90% fewer documents → lower Cosmos DB costs
2. **Performance**: Faster writes (1 document vs 12)
3. **Scalability**: System scales better with more users/goals
4. **Flexibility**: Easy to extend duration (just keep template active)
5. **Clean Database**: Only stores what users actually use

## Files Changed

### Frontend
- `src/pages/DreamsWeekAhead.jsx` - Template creation + on-demand instances
- `src/components/DreamTrackerModal.jsx` - Template creation for milestones
- `src/context/AppContext.jsx` - Template creation for consistency milestones
- `src/pages/VisionBuilderDemo.jsx` - (Already correct or doesn't create goals)

### API
- `api/getUserData/index.js` - Include templates in response

### Schema
- `src/schemas/item.js` - (Already had template schema)

## Next Steps

1. Test in local environment
2. Deploy to Azure
3. Monitor Cosmos DB document counts
4. Verify no performance issues
5. Consider cleanup script for old 12-instance goals (optional)

---

**Result**: Cosmos DB now stores **only necessary data**, creating week instances as users need them rather than speculatively.
