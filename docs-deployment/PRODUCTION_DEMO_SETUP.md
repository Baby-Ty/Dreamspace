# Production Demo Users Setup

## Problem Solved
The demo login at https://dreamspace.tylerstewart.co.za was showing a white screen because there was no proper demo user data in the production Cosmos DB.

## Solution
Instead of maintaining separate demo logic, we're adding 4 realistic demo users directly to the production Cosmos DB as real users. This means:

- ✅ Demo users appear in all parts of the application alongside real users
- ✅ No separate demo logic needed - they're just regular users
- ✅ Demo login works by loading Sarah Johnson from the production database
- ✅ Full coaching relationships and realistic data
